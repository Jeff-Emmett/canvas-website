## Gesture Tips

- **Accuracy**: Draw gestures clearly and completely for best recognition
- **Size**: Gestures work at various sizes, but avoid extremely small or large drawings
- **Speed**: Draw at a natural pace - not too fast or too slow
- **Shift Key**: Hold Shift while drawing to access layout gestures
- **Selection**: Most gestures work on selected shapes, so select shapes first if needed

## Keyboard Shortcut

- **`g`**: Activate the gesture tool

- If a gesture isn't recognized, try drawing it more clearly or at a different size
- Make sure you're using the gesture tool (cursor should change to a cross)
