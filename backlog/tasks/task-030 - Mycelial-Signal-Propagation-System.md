## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement a biologically-inspired signal propagation system for the canvas network, modeling how information, attention, and value flow through the collaborative space like nutrients through mycelium.

Core concepts:
- Nodes: Points of interest, events, people, resources, discoveries
- Hyphae: Connections/paths between nodes (relationships, routes, attention threads)
- Signals: Urgency, relevance, trust, novelty gradients
- Behaviors: Gradient following, path optimization, emergence detection

Features:
- Signal emission when events/discoveries occur
- Decay with spatial, relational, and temporal distance
- Aggregation at nodes (multiple weak signals → strong signal)
- Spore dispersal pattern for notifications
- Resonance detection (unconnected focus on same location)
- Collective blindspot visualization (unmapped areas)

The map becomes a living organism that breathes with activity cycles and grows where attention focuses.
