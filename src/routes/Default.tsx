      <h2>Hello! üëãüçÑ</h2>
      <p>
        My research investigates the intersection of mycelial patterns and emancipatory
        technologies. I am interested in the potential of new convivial tooling
        as a medium for group consensus building and collective action, in order
        to empower communities of practice to address their local challenges in an 
        age of ecological and instititutional collapse.
      </p>

      <p>
        I let my curiosity about mushrooms guide me, taking inspiration from their 
        willingness to playfully experiment and adapt, even in the most chaotic environments. 
        I am fascinated by the potential of mycelial networks to create new forms of bottoms-up
        sensing, collective cohereing around sensible directions, and emergent dynamic action 
        towards addressing local challenges.
      </p>
